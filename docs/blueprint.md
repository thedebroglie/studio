## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark background (#000000 or a very dark gray) to create a modern and secure feel, similar to the provided image.
- Secondary color: White or light gray (#FFFFFF or #E0E0E0) for text and UI elements to ensure readability against the dark background.
- Accent color: A vibrant cyan or turquoise (#00FFFF or #40E0D0) for the primary call-to-action button and key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: A clean, modern sans-serif font like 'SF Pro Display', 'Helvetica Neue', or 'Arial' for a crisp and professional appearance.
- Use simple, minimalist line icons in white or the accent color to maintain a clean and uncluttered interface.
- Design the interface with a focus on clarity and simplicity. Use a card-based layout where appropriate, with rounded corners for a softer feel. Ensure ample whitespace to avoid a cluttered look.
- Implement subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience. For example, a smooth fade-in effect when loading new content or a subtle hover effect on buttons.
